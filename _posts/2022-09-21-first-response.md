## [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) by Vannevar Bush, 1945

 Vannevar Bush wrote this Atlantic article at the tail end of the worst mass atrocity the world had ever seen. His role was to bring the cutting edge of science into the American war effort in order to give the Allied Powers a leg up over the Axis Powers. In this article, however, he turns away from war and tries to imagine what the world might look like in a time of peace. He seems to want to prove that the technologies that he has helped develop in furtherance of destruction could also be useful for the development of humankind.
 
 As in any attempt to predict the future, he makes plenty of predicitons that now seem laughable, but overall, it is a remarkably prescient article. One of his fundamental observations is that, "The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it." He was completely right that as devices get more complex and less expensive, the world was bound for an automation and data revolution. 

 Much of the later portion of the article is devoted to what application this data revolution has for the roadmap of the humanities. He imagines a "mechanized private file and library" and predicts that "any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf." This is in large part what digital libraries and repositiories seek to accomplish. From the Perseus project to Google Books and e-readers  like the Kindle, Bush was very much correct that in both academic and personal settings, it would not be long before we relied on computers to store humanity's collective knowledge or just make reading a bit more convenient. Crucially, there are not only libraries, but also what he calls "trail blazers." These trail blazers would make their ways through the endless digital archives and draw connections where they had not previously been made to reveal the true stories of the progression of human progress.
