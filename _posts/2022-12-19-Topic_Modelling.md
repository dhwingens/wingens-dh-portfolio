## Response

In this article, Blei provides a brief but useful summary of what topic modeling is and speicificallly, what latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is. He also discusses probabalistic modeling more broadly. The main audience for this article seems to be humanities scholars who do not already have a strong technical understanding. I wonder if an article like this could be more impactful if it appeared not in the Journal of Digital Humanities but in a more standard humanistic journal or someplace that folks who are not likely to already be familiar with the technologies available for text analysis would be more likely to read.

By far the most interesting part of this article to me was the "rosy vision" that Blei puts forward regarding topic modeling in the future of humanities research. This is a future where "A humanist imagines the kind of hidden structure that she wants to discover and embeds it in a model that generates her archive. The form of the structure is influenced by her theories and knowledge." He is describing the idealized relationship between technology and humanities that we have seen predicted many times in this class. Certainly it is possible that digital tools have been used this way and will be used this way in the future. There are some academics who are drawn to uncovering patterns in texts that may just too large or hidden for any individual to detect. That being said, I will note that this article was written in 2012. Ten years later, it seems difficult to say that this approach has taken hold in a widespread way. Most humanities researchers remain ignorant of digital tools or do not think them interesting enough to be worth pursuing. I wonder if this is an issue of a steep learning curve on techniques like topic modeling and failure to make these tools accessible, or if it is an issue of unwillingnes to learn. Either way, 10 years later and Blei's rosy picture has yet to emerge.
