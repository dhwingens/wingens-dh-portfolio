## [Technology is Taking Over the Digital Humanities](https://newrepublic.com/article/117428/limits-digital-humanities-adam-kirsch), Adam Kirsch May 2014 in *The New Republic*

I found Kirsch's article really interesting in the way that it interrogates what the value of the digital humanities really is. Rather than seeing the digital humanities as a brilliant new tool for textual analysis, Kirsch sees the digital humanities as more of a novelty that has made its way into a place of importance it probably does not deserve. Interestingly, I get the sense that most of my English professors tend to think along the lines of Kirsch's argument. I too think that it is is to some extent true that "digital tools, no matter how powerful, are themselves incapable of generating significant new ideas about the subject matter of humanistic study." It has been eight years since this article was published and I don't think that English departments or literary scholars have been replaces by machines or even that computers have helped make very many major insights into the study of literature.

At the same time, I think that Kirsch may be overly alarmist or critical of the digital humanities. He seems to be sounding the alarm bells that this mindless analysis will replace real, human thought, but I think that in the intervening years, it has become even clearer that digital tools are really there to aid scholars in their research. At this point, software cannot really make major insights about literature, but it does offer another way for scholars to look at texts and answer the questions that they have been grappling with for centuries. 

One other critique that I found interesting was that "the field has no common essence: it is not a species but at best a genus, comprising a wide range of activities that have little relationship with one another." In essence, the digital humanities are far too wide-ranging to have any coherent theory. It is just a collection of somewhat related tools that might be useful but do not constitute a distinct field. This seems pretty true to me, but I once again think that DH is better seen as a method of research and not a big scary haze overtaking humanities departments.
