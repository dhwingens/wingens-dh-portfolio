## Response:

Mimno's article provides an excellent overview of and justification for the use of digital humanities across disciplines, but especially in classics. It serves as a strong rebuttal to claims of skeptics that digital humanities tools generally just confirm what experts already know while creating separation from the source text. Mimno makes the point that much of what he tries to show in this article is not just a supplement to close reading, but is indeed impossible to do without computers. There is simply too much content to be read and analyzed and even the most committed of scholars could hardly scratch the surface of available knowledge. Computers allow for meta-analyses and help give scholars a sense of their field as a whole.

Mimno also discusses some of the challenges of building sufficient digital corpora. He looks at 24 journals and discusses the process of making them machine-readable with OCR. One aspect of DH that this highlighted to me was that because it is both a humanistic and a technological discipline, there are often decisions that require the exactness that a computer demands even though they concern inexact sources. These decisions can be somewhat arbitrary and give the sense that the analysis might change just at the whim of the person conducting it. Specifically, removing stop-words or very uncommon words from an analysis can improve efficiency and ability to produce meaningful results, but also opens up an analysis to some degree of randomness and arbitrariness.

Mimno also says that as useful as DH tools can be in and of themselves, one of their most important applications should be to support close reading. I agree that in theory it could be useful to scholars to be able to use DH to enhance their close reading, I also know that scholars who do not specifically study DH have generally been quite slow in adopting its techniques. I don't know if this should be chalked up to closed-mindedness from more traditional scholars or a failure to make resources available and approachable to those without technical knowledge, but either way, there has been a disconnect that has prevented DH from catching on in the way Mimno foresaw.
