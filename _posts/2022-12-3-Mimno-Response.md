## Response:

Mimno's article provides an excellent overview of and justification for the use of digital humanities in classics and humanities more generallly. It serves as a strong rebuttal to claims of skeptics that digital humanities tools generally just confirm what experts already know while creating separation from the source text. Mimno makes the point that much of what he tries to show in this article is not just a supplement to close reading, but is indeed impossible to do without computers. There is simply too much content to be read and analyzed and even the most committed of scholars could hardly scratch the surface of available knowledge. 

Mimno also discusses some of the challenges of building sufficient digital corpora. He looks at 24 journals and discusses the process of making them machine-readable with OCR. One aspect of DH that this highlighted to me was that because it is both a humanistic and a technological discipline, there are often decisions that need to be made that seem somewhat arbitrary, and are up to the discretion of the person conducting the analysis. Specifically, removing stop-words or very uncommon words from an analysis can improve  efficiency and ability to produce meaningful results, but also opens up an analysis to some degree of randomness and arbitrariness.
