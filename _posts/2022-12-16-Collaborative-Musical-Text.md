## Response

I was really interested in what this article had to say about the evolving nature of collaboration. Academic disciplines that traditionally have stayed far away from each other, but the digital humanities are bringing change and an increase in surprising collaborations. One of the authors' key takeaways is that "digital work is best done not for someone, but with them." The people crunching the numbers, pulling together data sources and conducting the analysis are not just working *for* humanities experts but in tandem with them. The process works much better when everyone is respected and receives credit as an equally member of the team.
Another element of collaboration in the humanities that has changed since the incorporation of technology is its scale. The projects the article describes were very large in scale and required a global network of academics and students. This kind of collaboration would have been impossible or extremely onerous a couple decades ago. Today, however, the ease and speed of international communication over large networks makes it an almost trivial hurdle if a given project requires it.
