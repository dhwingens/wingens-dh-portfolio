## Response

For my last post, I thought it might be interesting to go back to the first assigned reading of the semester. This is before we had even begun reading about the digitial componenst of the digital humanities and is an article discussing what the humanities are (is?) and why we study them.

The article repeats many times and in many different words that the humanities ultimately boil down to humans studying humans. There is something unique to the human exoerience which each humanistic discipline tries to study in its own way. The last couple weeks of the class, and the rapid rise of chatGPT have me thinking about how the future might be filled with not only technical disciplines being overrun by machanization and AI, but also the humanities. The article discusses how humanists seek to uncover patterns in what humans do. These days, it seems like there is no reason that any human should bother trying to uncover patterns. Any pattern that a human mind can see, a computer can see more clearly. As we feed historical data to machines, and as the data of human life is being contatnly recorded in the digital age, it can seem like the niche for the humanists is shrinking. 

Still, while computers can intake data about everything that mankind has wrought, it cannot drive the future of humanistic disciplines. Even ChatGPT, which is so fluent at writing stories and poems, can only really draw on what has already been done, and is not very good at writing beyond amalgamating platitudes.

Although the book is quite recent, I wonder if Drees's outlook on the humanities has changed much.

For what it's worth, ChatGPT is probably better at this than I am:
```
In his essay "What Are the Humanities?", William Drees defines the humanities as "the study of human culture and experience." He explains that the humanities encompass a wide range of disciplines, including literature, history, philosophy, art, and music, among others. These disciplines help us to understand the complexities of the human experience and provide insight into the ways in which people have interacted with the world around them throughout history.

One of the key arguments that Drees makes in his essay is that the humanities are important because they allow us to gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the world. By studying the works of great writers, philosophers, and artists, we can gain insight into the ways in which people have grappled with fundamental questions about the nature of the human condition. This, in turn, can help us to better understand our own thoughts and feelings, and to develop a more nuanced perspective on the world around us.

Another important point that Drees emphasizes is that the humanities are not just an academic pursuit, but are also relevant to our everyday lives. The insights and understanding gained through the study of the humanities can inform our personal and professional lives, as well as our relationships with others. It is through the humanities that we can gain a greater appreciation for the diversity of human cultures and experiences, and learn to respect and value the perspectives of others.

Overall, Drees's essay makes a compelling case for the importance of the humanities in our lives. By studying the humanities, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the world, and develop a more nuanced and empathetic perspective on the world around us. So, the humanities are a crucial aspect of a well-rounded education, and should be valued and supported in our society.
