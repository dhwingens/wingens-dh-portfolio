## Evaluation

I am evaluating the Sefaria digital library, which is the by far largest and most comprehensive online library of Jewish texts. Its texts range from the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) to 21st century rabbinic responsa. To varying degreees, the texts are available in Hebrew, English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Yidish, Polish, and even [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto). The library was designed with an eye towards individual study; the website is easily navigable, and contains plenty of explanatory notation. That being said, it also serves as a remarkable store of textual data both ancient and modern.

Aside from having a hugely varied library of Jewish texts in many languages, it also has a number of different translations available for the more common langauges. For the book of Genesis, for example, there are 34 distinct translations, including 13 English translations. It is extrmely easy to download any of these versions as a text, JSON or CSV file. Some applications in DH that I can think of for this would be comparing the 1917 and 2006 versions that are both from the Jewish Publication Society. Additionally, I could see some interesting results coming from a comparison between a translation from a more academic publisher (such as JPS) and a more religious publisher (like the Chabad version) to see where the biggest discrepancies arise and how their language tends to differ. Translation acts as the first, and often overlooked, step in intepretation, and it may be valuable to understand how differentt groups think about their holiest texts by understanding how they translate them differently.

Sefaria is completely open source, and relies largely on volunteers to build out their database. They also support a live API, which allows for Sefaria texts and translations to be integrated into apps, websites or any website that needs live-updating Jewish texts. Through their [github repo](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Export), anyone can download all of Sefaria's texts all at once, along with a database of all known connections between different texts.
