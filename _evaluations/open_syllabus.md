## Evaluation

The Open Syllabus Galaxy is an excellent and dynamic data visualization from Open Syllabus, which boasts a huge collection of university syllabi from around the world. The Galaxy contains the "1,138,841 most frequently assigned texts in the Open Syllabus corpus, a database of 7,292,573 college course syllabi." The visualization is a map of millions of circles of varying sizes and colors, which represent the popularity of a given text among the syllabi and the field to which they belong respectively. In addition to the colors denoting fields that the individual works are classified as belonging to, the map is roughly divided into regions for the fields of the syllabi. For example, there is a region dedicated to English literature, which is itself divided into American and British secitons. Crucially, these lines are not clearly defined as related fields bleed into each other. The barriers between English and History, or Chemistry, Physics, Math and Engineering are difficult to discern. It is fascinating to see how different disciplines relate and interact both by seeing how the regions of the map interact, but also by seeing the proliferation of different colored circles speckling parts of the map that they don't seem to belong in.

There is a search feature that allows the user to look for a specific title or author, and will return a list of matching works in the database along with a heatmap of your search term overlaying the map. This allows the user to understand prominence of any specific work or the intellectual reach of an author. I, for instance, entered in George Orwell, and was surprised by just how wide his reach is. His works appear thousands of times in the database and are most common in in literature and history syllabi, but also appear in politics, economics and even engineering syllabi.

The database is formed mainly through webscraping publicly available syllabi, and gets some data from individual professor submissions. This might be an insurmountable methdological problem because it is not really a random sample of syllabi. Instead, they are mostly limited to the schools that happen to post their syllabi publically. This may lead to an oversampling of syllabi from certain countries or types of schools, although I do not know what exactly this looks like.

This database and visualization are important because they can be of great use to groups like academics making syllabi and people studying academia. Professors designing courses can benefit from knowing the broad consensus on where a text fits, what texts are commonly linked with it, and how commonly it is taught. Someone performing a meta-analysis of acaedemia could use this data to point to areas where certain voices seem underrepresented or overrepresented, and which fields are slow to incorporate diverse voices.
